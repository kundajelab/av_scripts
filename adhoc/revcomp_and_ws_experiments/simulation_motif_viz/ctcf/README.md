Conclusion: takes a shockingly small number of examples to learn the ctcf motif (can get away with as little as 100 positives) if you have some kind of reverse complementation. It fails w/o the reverse complementation. I think the reason the siamese network works is that you only have to learn either the forward or the reverse version of the motif. This obviously wouldn't hold when you have other motifs present which can occur in different orientations. So I am going to try the talgata simulation next.
